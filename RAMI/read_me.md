RAMI was developed by SERVIR-Amazonia. The development team includes Lucio Villa, Milagros Becerra, Sidney Novoa, Osmar Yupanqui, and John Dilger. 

	The RAMI curriculum was organized by SERVIR’s Science Coordination Office. The modules were heavily influenced by “Chapter A1.8: Monitoring Gold Mining Activity Using SAR”  from the Open-Source Book “Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine: Fundamentals and Applications”. This chapter was written by Lucio Villa, Sidney Novoa, Milagros Becerra, Andrea Puzzi Nicolau, Karen Dyson, Karis Tenneson, and John Dilger. Special thanks to Sarah Dupont and Tomas Munita of Amazonaid for provision of photographs included in the curriculum materials
